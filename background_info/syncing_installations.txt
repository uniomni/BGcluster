(a partial debian mirror). This is an example on how it worked on my machine.
Replace actual names with those on yours.

  1: Install apt-move (use version 4.2.27-3, see: packages.debian.org/sid/i386/apt-move/download )
  
  2: Edit /etc/aptmove.conf, in particular:
       
       localdir = /home/web/dm_web/debian 
       
       #This is where you publish your packages.
       #It will appear as a URI address to others, 
       #e.g. http://datamining.anu.edu.au/debian
       

       APTSITES="mirror.aarnet.edu.au_pub_debian mirror.aarnet.edu.au_pub_debian 
                 ftp.debian.org_debian non-US.debian.org security.debian.org"
       
       #These are the same sites appearing in your /etc/apt/sources.list,
       #but with slashes (/) replaced with underscores (_). 
       #E.g. mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/debian becomes mirror.aarnet.edu.au_pub_debian
       #This was not mentioned in the docu. 

       
  3: Add line
       deb file:/home/web/dm_web/debian unstable main contrib non-free
     to the top of your local /etc/apt/sources.list  
     
  4: Run 
       apt-move update   
     to install your packages.
     (Optionally run apt-move mirror to make a complete mirror.)
     
  5: Add line
       deb http://datamining.anu.edu.au/debian unstable main contrib non-free
     to the top of /etc/apt/sources.list on the machine you wish to upgrade using 
     your local installation. 
       
	
Syncing installations:

 #On main machine:	
 dpkg --get-selections > dpkg-selections
 
 #On machine to be upgraded
 dpkg --set-selections < dpkg-selections
 apt-get dselect-upgrade
